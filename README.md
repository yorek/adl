# Azure CLI Script

A script language created from AZ CLI commands to make deployment and management of Azure resources as simple and intelligent as possibile. It helps to reduce by 40% the code you need to write!

## Goal

For this first realease the goal is to support all available AZ CLI commands and:

- remove all redundancy: no need to specify the same options again and again. 
- keep command signature and options consistent across all commands: in some AZ commands the resource name is not specified using the --name option. AZ  Script will correct that.
- provide context-aware environment so every command knows what happened before and can act accordingly

For example, if you want all your resources deployed into the 'eastus' region you can just write

```
location use 'eastus';
```

and all subsequent command will use that location, if not explicity overridden in the command itself. **Same logic can be applied to any resource that depend on other resource.** Storage accounts for example, or VPNs.

## Language

The language has been created so that you can reuse everything you already know from AZ CLI. For example to create a storage account with AZ CLI you would type something like

```
az group create -n 'dmk1' -l 'eastus'
az storage account create -g 'dmk1' -n 'dmk1storage' -l 'eastus' --sku 'Standard_LRS'
az eventhubs namespace create -g 'dmk1' -n 'dmk1ingest' -l 'eastus' --sku 'Standard' --capacity 20
az eventhubs eventhub create -g 'dmk1' -n 'dmk1ingest-32' --message-rention 1 --partition-count 32 --namespace-name 'dmk1ingest'
az eventhubs eventhub consumer-group create -g 'dmk1' -n 'cosmos' --eventhub-name 'dmk1ingest-32' --namespace-name 'dmk1ingest'
```

with AZ Script you would write

```
location use 'eastus';

group create 'dmk1';

storage account create 'dmk1storage' (
	sku: 'Standard_LRS'		
);

eventhubs namespace create 'dmk1ingest' (
	sku: "Standard",
	capacity: 20
);

eventhubs eventhub create 'dmk1ingest-32' (
	message-retention: 1,
	partition-count: 32
);

eventhubs eventhub consumer-group create 'cosmos';
```
 
isn't that so much better?

## Extensibility

AZ Script is written in Python and can easily be extended to support any kind of Azure resource just by writing a simple plugin, which is nothing more than a class derived from the base class ```Handler```. Really easy!.

The (somehow) supported resources, right now, are

- appservice
- cosmosdb
- eventhubs
- extension
- functionapp
- iot
- resource group
- storage

More will come in near future, stay tuned.

## Install

### Runtime Only

If you're not interested into developing Azure Script compiler, just use the usual `pip` tool:

	pip install azsc

Done. You may want to take a look at the samples folder to get started with Azure Script:

[Azure Script Samples](./samples)

### Development Enviroment

If you want to help in developing Azure Script compiler, is strongly recommended that you use virtualenv to setup a isolated environment:

	virtualenv env --python=<path_to_python_3>

in my case, since I have installed Python 3 as part of Visual Studio 2017, the full command is the following:

	virtualenv env --python="C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\Shared\Python36_64\python.exe"

and then activate it (for Linux see [here](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/userguide/#usage))

	.\env\Scripts\activate

you can then install required packages:

	pip install -e .

and you're done, you can start using it.

## Usage

Just run the `azsc` compiler, passing the script file you want to compile.

```
azsc <filename.azs> [--debug]
```

will generate the AZ CLI commands needed to do what defined in the script file.
`--debug` will also print the parse tree for debugging purposes

As a starting sample you can use the `e2e-1.azs` script:

	azsc .\samples\e2e-1.azs

it will generate AZ CLI script ready to be executed in a [WSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux) bash.

## Compilation

The result of compiling is, at present time, a transpilation to AZ CLI commands. The entire process is completely extensibile, so in future plugins to generate ARM templates or even direct REST API calls could be created.

## Notes

Grammar definition is done using EBNF format and the parses is [Lark](https://github.com/lark-parser/lark)

## Roadmap

For now this is just an experiment. Let's see where it goes...

But if you're curious here's something I have in mind:

- Support syntax highlighting Visual Studio Code (done: https://github.com/yorek/azure-script-vscode)
- Support for and code completion in Visual Studio Code
- Build a graph of dependencies and the run as many AZ CLI commands in parallel as possibile
- Using the dependency graph, validate the command even before running them
- Define a clever way to deal with erros like:
	- automatic retry 
	- break the scripts
	- take compensating actions
- Generate Powershell Script
- Generate ARM template
- Execute the commands instead of just generating a script
